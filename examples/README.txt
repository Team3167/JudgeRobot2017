These examples demonstrate a method of transmitting image data from the RoboRio to a Raspberry Pi (or any other device), and then receiving some response data in return.

I've tested these under Linux, so I expect that they will run OK on the Raspberry Pi (run both scripts from the RPi simultaneously), but they may also work on Windows.  As uploaded, the IP address configuration assumes both scripts will be run on the same machine, but it should not be difficult to modify this to run them on different machines.

Let me know if you've got any questions.  Good luck!
